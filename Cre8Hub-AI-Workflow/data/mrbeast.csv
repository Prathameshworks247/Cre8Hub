I Went Back To Boy Scouts For A Day,"I Went Back To Boy Scouts For A Day

 We are joining the Boy Scouts in getting all the badges and whichever one of you has the most badges at the end of the day wins $10,000 The first badge is the wilderness survival badge Whichever one of you guys starts a fire first gets this badge go first time ever starting a fire It's kind of hard. I would recommend you copy Chris. So what are you doing? I'm trying to get my kindling going and scrape some of this magnesium. It sounds like you're a Boy Scout. I already know what I'm doing Towards art. No. This isn't Pokemon. Ooh, Chandler's getting some smoke. He's cheating. You can do what you want. I didn't know that. Chandler, I brought you a helper. I just feel like you'll need it. Put your fuse more into the leaves. How old are you? I am 10. Oh! Car roll started to fire! Got it. Put it down. Put it down. There you go. And Carl won the first badge on the archer. We got the bread. I got the water. Let's keep winning. Next is the archer badge. If you hit the target, you get the badge. Chandler's up first. Let's go. I'm kind of tearful. Oh! Oh! Good job, Chandler. You got your first badge. Up next is Chris. I think you might not hit it. Oh! Oh! Look underneath. It's under the target. No, it's in the target. As we see, it is in the target. Good job, Chris. You got the archer badge. Back up. You're too. Do you think she'll hit the target? She can do anything. She puts her mind to. Except for that. Oh. Oh. All right, Carl. Let's go to her. If Carl misses this, me, Chandler and him will all be tied for the lead. I ain't missing nothing, bro. Carl, you're doing great. So far, Carl has one badge. Chris has one badge. Becca has none and Chandler has the badge. Onto the next one. Next badge is rock climbing and you need to climb the wall of doom. That dude. Good luck, guys. Dude, there's no way I can do this. How many tries do I get? We'll do three. Three. I'm about to go, but I'm very scared. This bad boy is so tall. There's no way. Oh, I'm about to catch a cramp. This is so hard. If it makes you feel better, little kids do this. Oh! Take number two. You got this, Chandler. Only like 80% left. Yeah. Are you tapping? So you sure you don't want to just give them? Yeah. Chandler ran away. Chris, it is your turn. I'm so scared. Hi, man. It's not gripping. This one's bad. Oh, I don't have a lot of strength. I don't do sports. Where's the computer science badge? How's your grip? This is my last one. We're going barefoot. How can you do it? It's all my big toe. 10,000 dollars. Oh my god, I'm so scared. All right, Chris, you didn't get a badge. He just dragged me off. Becca, you're turned. Becca, please do better than me. Are you going to be able to reach him? I don't know. Didn't you rock climb? I have. Wow, she used to rock climb. She codes. Cool. She's already higher than me. I really can't feel my fingers right now. Hey, do you need a banana? Oh my god. She's about to make it. Wow. Children gather around. I'm going to be honest. Becca did a good job. She deserves it. Here you go. Thank you. I haven't gone. Oh, yeah, Carlos, you're turned. Thank you. All right, everything about you looks just so uncomfortable right now. Oh, it is. Are you going to do this? I was actually born on a rock climbing wall. Nice habit, feet. Where to? I am weird. You're doing great, Carl. What if we just take a look at you? My whole body hurts so bad. Oh, my whole foot is bleeding. It's for... Oh, gosh. Carl cut himself in his forfeiting. Becca got a badge for going up pretty high. What's Carl high enough for a badge? Carl was, yes. Maybe three more rocks. Three more rocks ought to give it to him. All right. Are you honking with me right now? The next badge is cross the log badge. Walk across the log to the other side and touch this cord. Face your first. Go whenever you feel like it. Boom. Long crossing badge. Chandler, you're turned. Me? All right, I'm going to go. Oh, he touched it. He got it. Congrats. Yes. Becca, you're a turn. Look at the wobble. Book it. A for effort. Let's go. Oh, go on. Oh, you're coming. He got it. Oh. All right, to the next one. Teams up to you must get to the other side of this wall. Chandler, Becca, just want us to get up, right? All I said is I have to get to the other side of the wall. I didn't say the app could go over it. Let's start off with Carl and Becca. Okay, I'm going to get on my knee. Do you think they can get to the other side of the wall? Probably. Nah, there's no way. Okay, ready? Yeah. Oh, wait, wait. Child's play, baby. Whoa. Whoa. We're going to see them do the same thing. By the way. There's your badge. Just another day in the park. On to your shoulder. Oh my god. Two. Oh, yeah, baby. I just got really dizzy. You might be kind of dizzy, but maybe this will help you. Hey, Chandler, here's your badge. Next up, you're going to climb the rope of doom. Why's everything of doom here? Have any trust? Let's do one. Three, one, two, zero, one, deal. All right. I'm really trying. I'm not even joking. I'm just not really good at anything other than watching TV, okay? Dude, that's the long way up. Shut up. I don't like heights. Heights all like you. Do you ever think about that? Chris. Chris. Chris. You could taste it, Chris. One more. He did it. Plus, Benny. It's like a little spider coming down. Here is your rope-planted badge. You're up to four badges. Becca has begun. Becca's annihilating. That seems much easier for you than Chris. I would just like to thank my mom for being so short. Wow. Good job. I did it. All I have to say is that you're garbage, you don't know what you're doing. Hey, got him. No. Here is another badge. Chandler's turn. Go, boy. Climb on. Ah! So, at this point in my life, I'm deciding whether I want to go up or not. Don't do it, you nerd. I don't feel like doing this anymore. No badge game. That's what the badge you would have got looks like. At least you get a hugging badge. I've been missing the way you touch me, baby. Don't worry, you don't got this. Oh, boy. Yep. You got to go fast. Find more. Here's your dead end. I'll find you. So, anyways, Carl, here you go. Oh. Oh, let's continue. Next badge is the navigation badge. I want all of you to put a hand straight up. Now, point which way you think is North. This is where my instinct. We'll start off with Becca. You're not right. North is that way. You moved it. You just qualified. No. North is that way. Chris wants to close this. He gets the badge. I have a very important announcement. Whoever has the most badges gets 10 grand, right? Yes. 90 more. It's now 20,000. You're going down. I will try my best. That is all I can do. Stay in the lead and I'm going to bring him this 20 grand. I'm the underdog and I think that I deserve it the most because of that. First place has six badges. I have five. Guess what? Doesn't matter. I'm going to do it right now. Too bad, Ari. Took 60k from you loser. The next few badges are a little slow so I'm just going to tell you how they went. Chandler actually won three badges. Carl also won three badges. And somehow Chris won four badges. And Becca won one. This next badge is a sling shop badge. You're each going to fire three times. The two people who hit it the least. Don't get a badge. Alright, let's begin. Carl, fire. You hit it. Chris. Yes. Becca. No. It was the wire. I'll hit it. Sorry. Wait, really? Yeah, it was the wire. Chandler. You just took mine. Woo! Chandler hit it. So far, Carl and Chandler is hit one. Another round. Chandler, fire. Wow. Becca, fire. Chris. Oh, it went under it. Carl. It's the only Chandler hit it. You two never hit one. You two did hit it and you two get badges. You hit your badge on your hands. Chandler, here you go. Boom. What if you guys did rock paper scissors for a badge? I'm going to afford to lose one. One and done. Rock paper scissors shoot. Hold up. Turn around. I went with scissors, man. You lost. You're too happy. Because I still got one more badge than him. No, you don't. 97, now it's 8-8. Why do I do math? I'm so bad at it. Let's do our treat again. But this time we're moving the targets further back and giving you three shots. The target in front of you is yours. Fire. No. Brow. Raise the bowies. And fire. Oh, I hit the wood. Chris, didn't you do competitive archery? Yeah, but I used 20 million people for watching. I used it different kind of bow. And fires. Yeah, baby. Badge me. I'm angry because my pride is hurt twice. I couldn't start a fire. I couldn't shoot the bow right. I'm not... The bow hit me in the arm as you can see. After that, I just got shaky. I was off to a rocky start and then it ended in a rockier start. I'm counting nine badges online and eight on those posters over there. Next, Boy Scout Badge is the best well-badge and you have to hit a half-square shot to get it. That's not a Boy Scout Badge. Shut up. Everyone gets one try. I'm really bad at basketball. What? Alright, Becca. Kobe. Alright, Carl. Carl's gonna make it. Oh. Caddy's in close. Chandler. Oh. The GoPro. The GoPro literally blocked me to reach from winning $20,000. That is your fault. The council said if you make a free throw, that's pretty bad. I'm terrible at free throw. If you make this, I will give you the best well-badge. Miss it. You made it. Just take this badge with the pride. Chandler got the best well-badge next stop. We just finished to have court shot and I'm actually gonna leave this behind and have them race to get it later. This next badge is a very hard badge. O'rhythmic badge. First to give the correct answer wins. The math problem is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 8 times 8 times 8 times 10 times 8 times 10 times 0. The same exact time. The two times, let's do this again. 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 is 128. Got it right. I got math right. Chris, congratulations. Thanks man. This next one is very, very important. Remember the basketball flip. I left a bottle of sun kiss in the middle of the court. Whoever can grab the bottle of sun kiss first wins. Okay, everybody's in the car. Gentlemen's agreement. 1, 2, 3, go. We all get out of the car and go for it. Yeah, hit it. Oh, yeah. Who got it? Say how to Chris get it over Chandler. I said, gentlemen's agreement. He's a snake. And then I did it. That is my friend. He betrayed me. Chris, you got the badge. But at what cost? Who cares? I don't care. If that's all that matters to you. Hey, have fun walking back, buddy. Where's the not being a jerk badge? So you have four badges. You have nine. You have nine. And you have nine badges. Except I haven't given you the sun kiss badge yet. You now have 10. And are in the lead. There's only one badge left. If you guys win, you can tie with Chris. Chris wins, he wins. This next one is woodworking. Whoever can carve the best picture wins. I'm not even going to try it. Chris is really going hard. Well, here's the thing, boys. We did team trees. We don't like to hurt wood. What is our friend Chandler never did? Chandler ends up winning the badge because he did not harm mother nature. Yeah, but there's a tie now. There is a tie. I made a plank from Edd and Nutty. That's actually kind of funny. I think we need to give him one as well. So three-way tie? Yeah. So you just go back on everything you said. Since you didn't harm the wood Chandler, go. Carl, you made me laugh. Boom. Everyone salute back. You did a good job. You did well. You did well. It's a three-way tie and you all have 10 badges. Pull out your phone. Turn on your screen, reporter. Open up YouTube. Are you subscribed to our channel? Do. Do. Oh, Carl was it. Carl was it subscribed. I made a new YouTube. Oh, sure. I lost hide and seek and boys scout. So now I'm out $80,000. Subscribe to Mr. Beast because you don't want to lose $20,000. It hurts, man. All this work has led us to this. The Epic Finale. We end how we began. First one to start a fire. It gets to $20,000. Good luck. Let's go, boys. This is it. $20,000. It needs to burn for at least 30 seconds. Begin. Oh, my God. Charlie, use everything you learned today. It's not for the money. It's for my pride. This was the one thing that I should have been able to do. And I couldn't. You're gonna let your sock on fire. Nothing serious. You can't do the same. Start the timer. Oh, my God. Half way. What a movie. Time. Congratulations, Chris. You have won. I made fire. And I lost the sock. Chris won the fire part to badge. And is now the most elite boys scout ever to exist. I'll get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. I'm going to get out there. You still love Chris? Yeah. You can then say I'm too convincing. I'm upset. Okay. Congrats on the $20,000. Now you can take care of your unborn child slightly better. I don't know. Subscribe. Bye. I'm going to get out there.",90976657,817,,"WATCH UNTIL THE END TO SEE THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL

That is because this theme park, one of the most busiest ones in America, just opened it. So you take a YouTuber with 20 million subscribers. You put them in a very public location to film a video. It's not a great formula. Chandler, we have to win the prizes here. I need you to hang for 90 seconds. 60 seconds. Do that. Oh! Oh! Oh! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! 5 down. 6 down. That's display we can't win it. Number 7. That is 7 games completely cleared out. And from those 7 games, these are all the prizes we won. Guys, we're well. Now, this may look like a lot. It's literally like a thousand stuffed animals. We're not even a quarter of the way done. So we're about to take things to the extreme. All right, Chandler. I need you to win all the prizes here. Guys, he's in charge of it. Don't let him leave. Win him all. Okay, Stan, can I count on you? I know. I can't count on him. Marcus and Chris, you guys are going to whack them all. Have that.

Chandler, I got your chicken. You got four buckets of chicken tenders. I don't remember where we were going to. This is number nine. This is number 11 and it looks like we didn't win much, but we really did. We just had to leave prizes because they won't let us win everything. If we clear out everything, that ruins the theme park. This is number 12, but as you see, we won all the prizes. This is number 13, the prizes were on the shelves. We can't win these things. Paying around the sides. So kids, my butt is being touched.

Oh, these girls, we just steal a big bang. What about you? You put a head of back on a better end. What a ring. On the box. Like this. I decided to come give these guys back up. They haven't won a single thing yet. I called in some blitz strategy. I don't think it's possible. I said, first one to hit one gets $500. First one to make a ring on the cup. $500. Go over there. They've been doing it for 20 minutes. Have a look at the single one. First one to make a ring on the cup with $500. The world is cheering you on. $500 on the line. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? I'm going to do a ring. I'm going to do a ring. I'm going to do a ring. I'm going to do a ring. I'm going to do a ring. Boys, it's now $1,000.

I want to win them all but it would just take too long. So guys we won almost every single prize in this entire park. Almost. Not bar hanging one? We cannot complete. And we missed the 3.1. I know, Taylor's bad. We literally could not get to it without a crowdfunding. Yeah guys we literally won 5, 6, 7, 10,000 different items. I don't know. 10,000 probably. I'm just making up a number. 10,000 items. This took the entire day. Now we're being honest. We have no use for all these toys. So we're actually going to give them back to the theme park because I don't want them to go to waste. The way? I want to live here. Well Chris is now living in the theme park. Do you want to live here? No. You want to go get a hot tub? Yes. I'll wrap up the video. I'll be there in a second. That's how you get rid of the challenge. Just tell me to go get a hot tub. And there you go. Subscribe, I'll be leaving you for a night account. Actually minecraft because it's relevant again. Help! Help!",124894381,801,,"WE WON OVER 10,000 STUFFED ANIMALS LOL

Toothpaste Life Hacks YOU SHOULD KNOW,"Toothpaste Life Hacks YOU SHOULD KNOW

 So I went through and watched all these toothpaste videos and they all have basically the exact same life hack. So we are going to test these life hacks and see if they're actually practical. Like this one from 5-minute crafts, it got 16 million views and the thumbnail is a cracked iPhone with toothpaste. Quick disclaimer, the microphone on my camera didn't work while I was recording, so I'm gonna have to make all the sound effects manually with my mouth. WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! WO-B-SH! Now we just rub it on the phone and it should fix the cracks. I mean it worked for this YouTuber and this one and this one and this one. I mean it's gotta work. And now we just rub a dub a dub a dub a dub a dub. Hit off and... What the hell? The cracks didn't go away. Wait, so you tell me those videos were clickbait? Oh... Sorry about your phone mom. The next toothpaste life hack involves you dipping a match in toothpaste and apparently if you dip a match in toothpaste you can submerge it and it will still work. Um, let's test it. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wow, this match works even though it's underwater. That... wait, what? You don't care? Yeah, me neither. The next life hack we are testing from these toothpaste life hacks videos is getting crown off your wall with toothpaste. All these viral videos claim that toothpaste is a good way to get crown markings off your wall. So let's test it. Does it actually work? So yeah, I got rid of the crown marks but it just left an even bigger mark on my wall. So whoever made these life hack videos can you uh... Can you apologize to my landlord for me? That'd be pretty awesome. And also I know it's pronounced crayon. I'm just pronouncing it weird just to piss people off. The next life hack we are testing comes from a video titled Six Awesome Toothpaste Life Hacks. And guess what guys? One of these six amazing life hacks is rubbing toothpaste on a CD to clean it. Yes, he recommended to almost three million people that they use toothpaste to clean their CDs. I call BS. I highly doubt this works. Let's test it. Who would have guessed? Now my disc is unreadable. Thank you for the six awesome toothpaste life hacks man. This life hack is insane. I love being able to break my video games that are worth $60. You know, I paid $60 for it. I love just rubbing toothpaste on it because some guy on the internet told me it would clean it. Toothpaste Life Hack number Quattro or Sinko, I don't know whatever we're on, is cleaning your headlights of your car with some toothpaste. And this one did work. Not gonna lie. You know, it did make my headlights a lot cleaner. But there's also a thing called soap and like dozens of other ways you could clean your headlights. But yes, if you're stranded on an island with just a car and some toothpaste and you need to clean your headlights, it will work. But it was honestly kind of weird rubbing toothpaste on my car. So apparently toothpaste and a water balloon makes like a stress relief squishy thing. I don't know. These life hacks are honestly stupid. Oh, that's a fuck. Are you racist? I am the least racist person that you have ever met. I am the least racist person. And the final life hack is apparently if you're like suicidal and burn your fingers a lot. You can rub toothpaste on it and I don't know. Just what the videos show, apparently it will sue that. It kind of helped. I don't know how sanitary it is. And I'm really hungry. So thank God this video is finally over. Holy crap. I'm ready to go eat some food. This is what I planned on using for the intro. It needs to come over and clean off that table because I don't feel like cleaning the toothpaste off of it. It's kind of disgusting. Yeah. Like and subscribe. And yeah, goodbye.",19647327,277,,"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED HOLY CRAP

"Can 50,000 Magnets Catch A Cannon Ball?","Can 50,000 Magnets Catch A Cannon Ball?

 Today we're gonna test multiple different ways to stop a cannon. We're gonna try magnets. Legos. A bulletproof vest. A mannequin. We put some baseballs in the cannon. We put some gloves on the people. Need I say more? Do you think this is the first time a baseball has ever been fired from a cannon? Can't be. Hey, Chandler, what's that? Maybe a lot of people. Whoa. The legs are standing. You're the glove, Petal. I'm very much down. Did the gloves broke? Did it go to the gloves? Kind of broke. Wow. Not on a baseball. Oh, wow. Here it is. Oh, here it is. Oh, my goodness. It's still perfect. Hold on, very. That is a crispy one. Is that what it smells like popcorn? It smells like popcorn. Is that so? Is that what popcorn? Oh, man, that smells bad. Smell it. This is legit real bulletproof glass. I'm actually curious if we'll stop this cannon. You don't think that the bulletproof glass can take a cannonball? No, it's a cannon. But you think so. Get it back. Get right there. It's right there. Whoa, the ball. Oh, wow. Yo, the bulletproof glass beat the cannonball. Dude, here's the cannonball. So I'm confused. Why didn't Blackbeard just have bulletproof glass? I know, right? Easy. We're watching the slow-mo, guys. What? That makes you jump. It's going to ride at you. I love it. Bulletproof glass can stop a cannon, but can a bulletproof vest? Let's say you become a couple of night and a guy of Rob's convenience store, he comes out with the cannon. Is your vest going to protect you? I will answer that. Well, by me, I'm in Brandon. I'm just here for the ride. We will answer it. Together. Because we're a power couple. Whoa, wow. How many? Oh my gosh, look. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. We caught it. Look at this beauty. If you had a chest made out of steel, you'd be fine. You know, the only come around once a year. Yeah. He did. He did, and I'll give you a thousand dollars. What'd you say? Never mind. Guys, we're going hot. We're going hot. I'm ready. You ready. Whoa. You are ready. Hey, Chandler. High five. High five. Whiz. Oh, you missed it. Oh, wow. Oh, my god. That was awesome. Oh my god, that was beautiful. Good thing we got on this five-degradable confetti. This right here is Manin. He's very self-conscious of the fact that he can't grow hair. It makes him Chandler. Don't talk about him. He said he's self-conscious. Stop being a bullet. So to make him feel better, we're going to take this wig. We're going to cram it in the can and then we're going to put a lot of that black powder stuff. And shoot it as his head and hopefully that allows him to feel more confident in his own skin. You look like the dude off of I-Robot, honestly. You know we'll smooth. Ah. Well, well, well, boys. We meet again. Going hot. Oh, going hot, guys. Going hot. Oh. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That wig. I did not expect that to be all of it. Dude, right in the chest. Look at that. He's just got an eye left. That's it. Where's that go, brother? I was still working. No way. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what the can it? This is for all you people who ever lost money to a v- I got revenge. Perfect. Guys, for a vending machine never steals money from you, hit it with the cannonball. Your vending machine didn't work. I accidentally broke it. I'm going to clean it up and take care of it. Okay? Yeah. Appreciate it. It's not starting. Blow it up as well. All right, boys, we're going to show this car who's boss. You go, go, run. Oh my god. That was kind of cool. Yeah, that was pretty dope. I got one more. That's way too much. That's way too much. Who's cannon made the most of my damage? Mine. Is this your cannon? You really yeeted the yeet cannon. Mine went all the way through it. My cannonball is right here, bro. That's your cannonball? They didn't even make it to the car. Oh my gosh. You can't even get in this passenger door. Look at this. That's dope. We're at stop-boss. We got an extra wound. Dude. I like that. You can see right there where it went through. Okay, Jimmy. Okay, let me get a high one. Wow. Now we're going to see if a Lego wall can stop a cannonball. Let's do this cannon, guys, ready? You just fire cannons and look hot. Yeah. Take your shirt off, by those shoes. Oh. Tell me the way. Oh my god. You're just going to see the actual ball on this. There it is. Oh. Right in the GoPro. It just clipped the top. Just clipped it. That's going to look good on the GoPro. We're not. We'll see right here. I've been struggling with cell phone service, so we're going to see if shooting it out of wall out of a cannon fixes that. Get it, sexy boy. Uh, good time. Did it go over? Wow. No, it didn't. It just annihilated it. It's in the lens. Are you serious? Wow. Wow. I better still work. On-skate. Hot. You're key of the unburnt. Hey, Dad. Oh, thanks. It works now. This is a fridge. This is a cannon. This is alphabet numbers and letters. Alphabet numbers and letters. Isn't the alphabet letters? This is very special to me. I love this. You know what, bud? What if it smells something on the fridge? It burned a O on it. No, hey. What? Hey, the A. And the E. And the E. Look at E. I love the alphabet magnet time working. Shoot him with the cannon. Here's a new game plan. This is a cannon. It's about this wide. That wide fits right there. So we're going to slide that cannon in here. Will it work, Brandon? Where do we, what? Oh, what? What do you got there? What do you got there? Oh my gosh. We need a third. We need a third. What do you got it? Oh, oh. What is this, Chandler? The cannon. And what is it inside of? The cannon. We have no idea what's going to happen. Like this literally might explode. Might. Probably will explode. So we should back away. Like a lot of way. Yeah. This is so dangerous that we're actually sitting in a U-Hone and watching it through these mirrors. All right. That's our front row seat viewers. Oh, wow. Fuses lit. We can't find the cannon. Yo, where did the cannon go? Oh my goodness. The cannon like disappears. Oh. You've got to be kidding me. I'm going all the way over here. How many yards do you all think that is? At least three. I think it's three plus 25. 20. So 20. Dude, that is the cannon right here. And that's where we shot it out. Oh my god. We have 50,000 magnets, a watermelon. And a cannon. So yeah, we're going to see if these 50,000 magnets can catch a cannonball midair. So here's big chungus. And this is a 40 pound cannonball. First, I'm scared. I don't want to break it. And you give it to Chandler? Yes. He's already broken half the stuff. Oh god. The oven is ready. All right. I'm going to slide it on like cannons. Where about to shoot the cannon? It's pinned up us. Dude, Tariq is so scared right now. Look at the rear. Why am I doing this? I'm scared. I'm scared. Oh my god. I'm terrified. Let's go here. Oh, man. Did we hit it? It did not stop it. The watermelon and the magnets couldn't stop it. What? Let's get a closer look. Did you like having a cannon ram through you? Yes. The 50,000 magnets didn't catch it out of the cannon. So maybe if I throw it slower, it will. It got one, two. Oh, Jesus. Chandler, you're tired. Are you sure? Yes. I'm not holding back. Use more than one percent of your power. Two percent. Man, you look the actual dent. Don't underestimate dumb strings. You see that? Hey, look, a pole at me. What is this? Chandler's left a dent. You see then.",67056612,568,,"YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY THIS!

Donating Big Donations To Twitch Streamers!!!,"Donating Big Donations To Twitch Streamers!!!

 And the words of our great PewDiePie, we should respect women. So my fellow women, respectors, put on your earbuds and let's get ready to respect some women. Professional women, respector here. Reporting for duty. Alright boys, I just began respecting this woman. We shall see. Mr. B, sub up, professional women, respector here. Reporting for... Respector, what's that? See, our men are so just terrible. Women don't even know how to be respected. She's so used to not getting respected. She doesn't even know what it is. You don't? No, but respect. Is? I apologize for my gender being severed. I am here to make an improvement. Change. This is $30 in real money, but you know, in your magical euro money... She appreciates our respect. That's all our... guys what? If more women were like her, we would respect them. We only must continue our journey. Alright, we found a new woman to respect. Hello. I am here to show you the respect you deserve. Thank you so much, Mr. Pistor. No problem. See you to respect you. But thank you so much. I respect that you respect me. Thank you. She respects our respect. That's all I wanted. Us guys want to... you know, we want it both ways. I really appreciate this. Since she respects my respect, we're going to have to respect her respect to my respect. We're going to have to hit her with the triple respects swirl. Here, have more respect. She's blown away by the respect. They're just not used to it anymore. It's sad. The society we live in, where women get this surprised by respect. Chat is for losers that don't respect. What do you mean? I don't respect women. It's called... Chat is for losers that don't respect women. That's why you don't see me in chat. You see me on donations. I don't like hugging people, but I think I would give you a high five. Your aim will just sweat. Like, can I sell my sweat on eBay? What? Who's this? Is he trying to one up me? I'll show this a little peasant. How would you respect women? No one. Out respects me. I'll show this guy how to respect women. Donating $30. I'll show him who's lost. Why is it doing that to her? You do. You're a woman. You deserve respect. We're not taught that in our culture. But... No one out respects me. I want to cry. That's so much money. I don't just walk the walk. I'm not gonna fucking say that. I'm gonna fucking say that. He's just... He's Asian! What? What is that Asian? No, it's not Asian. All right. Send Mr. Beast booby pics. I don't have tips. I don't want boobies. I just want to respect the flow. I don't want boobies. We haven't done it. I'm not going to respect him. We're against action being an opinion defendant. Don't ask me. The media just said that. This is the agency that ammo sausages and doughnuts. Not the airbags! I'll leave him as well. How do I put you? Leave him as well! He should've just killed you. You're not helping yourself with that video. I'm trying to respect you. Don't talk about my penis. This is not why I'm here. I'm here to stop this. I hope you like my bad dancing. It's not very good, but you know. Your dancing was not bad. I respect you. I feel very respected right now. Oh, what did she just said she feels respected? It makes me feel like I'm being very respected. Yes, respect it harder! Yes, I'm your harder! She feels appreciated and respected. I feel so accomplished. I'm ready. The skill of your dancing does not... Sorry. Okay, we're gonna dance. I respect you. I respect all women. I do. Alright, we're gonna hit her with the big one this time. Alright, we hit her with another donation, boys. This time we really stuck the respect to her. What is this? Why do people scream this? Thank you for the donation. Holy shit! Sorry, sorry. I'm very grateful. This is not... I respect all women. Well, okay. I will take that as a great compliment. Thank you very much. Please remove me as the top D that doesn't show my true intent. Respecting women. Okay. Sure. That's fine by me. I appreciate it. Very... There we go. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. I'm very blessed to have somebody like you. I should be the one bowing. I'm the one respecting you. So you guys can tell she clearly feels respected. It's time, you know, we move on and respect another female. So this next stream, we're gonna go hardcore respect mode. I'm gonna respect them so much. I gotta shield my eyes from the amount of respect about the poor out. Mr. Beast, what the heck? Mm-hmm. Thank you so much for the tip. Thank you so much. I mean, you're to show respect, but it looks like you were already doing that. Keep it up, my lady. Because I respect you. Thank you so much for the tip. I appreciate that you're enjoying the stream and showing your support like that. Dude, that is so sweet. Thank you so much. That totally surprised me. Sometimes I donate money to people and they don't really react. But she had a pretty good reaction, so now I kind of just want to give her more money. You respected me. I'm sorry. And for that, I can't never repay you. I can't repay you. Hi, here we go. Now we sent her some respect. That'll be rough. What the fuck? Dude, what? Dude, what? Mr. Beast, what the heck? Just doing my duty. Dude, that is a seriously ridiculously kukubanane-aise tip. What? Can we get a playback on that? That is a seriously ridiculously kukubanane-aise tip. Are you serious? I kind of don't want to donate more money. She might die of a heart attack. Earlier I gave money to a girl and she didn't even read the message. She's like going on about it for a minute. Like, I like people like this. I must leave, but I hope my respect lives on forever in your heart. I must leave, but I hope my respect lives on forever in your heart. I appreciate it. Dude, thank you so much. All right guys, we have our next female that deserves respecting right here. I can't even hear her. Turn down your game sound. I go through all this trouble to respect women and they have their game sound up like this. Did you call her honey? No. Somebody disrespected her. Who disrespected her? And called her honey? I apologize for my gender calling you honey. We need no harm. Is that like Aiden? I apologize for my gender calling... Who is this? What are you doing? I'm just respecting. What do you mean? What am I doing? She probably gets so much donations too. She doesn't even care about my... Here, have more respect. What? Who are we? What's that? There's a lot of donations, dude. Trying to be respectful. She appreciated the respect. Mission complete, boys. Special... Dude... What a dude. Lovery. A truck load a respect. For women, has arrived. Stop my ass! Stop my ass. Stop my ass. Mr. I got a load of respect for a woman has arrived. Ha ha ha. Respect. Thank you for the $20 my concern. You need to change it from making different because that is not respect. You won't get enough. I am here. Just wait. Yeah. Thank you. Stop my ass. Ha ha. You need to change it from making a rain because that is not respectful. And that's why I am here. To respect you. My name is... Hold it up. Ha ha ha ha. I'll follow you. Respect, woman. What should I change it to, man? Something respectful. It's hard for me to respect you. You don't want to be respected. I think we're gonna have to leave. This is inappropriate. I don't think you'd respect women. I'm going to have to... Thank you for being the man. Because of our lack of respect, we're gonna have to charge back. Stop my ass. 94. I don't think you respect women. I'm going to have to leave. Oh, wow. I respect women. Don't think you do. You make a rain and you use words like hose. It's not very respectful. I'm gonna have to leave with disgust. I can't... I just can't stand this disrespect. It's not what I stand for. All right, here's our next streamer. I've got so much respect pent up. It's not even funny. How has your respect been? Oh, what's your name? Yeah, Sheth has been really nice today. And I've been really nice to the people I've been paying with. So respect has been good. Respect has been good. That is good. What? You have been respected. Little lady. I'm glad you have been respected, my lady. You're so awesome. Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Beast. Thank you. I just want to triple check and make sure you get extra respect today. Oh, thank you so much, man. No problem. Yeah, don't worry. I'm getting lots of respect. Good. So I was here. She said chat was mean sometimes. How dare they not say that? That's not very respectful. Oh, my goodness. We need to make up for that. I apologize for my gender being mean to you sometimes. I don't understand what respect is. All right, guys. I'm about to sprinkle the last little bit of respect. I'm about to sprinkle the last little bit of respect. Before we move on, the donation hits will be yours. Let's see. Oh, oh, my God. They're right with the meadrock. The music's loud. I can't hear my respect. My gender. Oh, yeah. It's fine. Don't worry. But if you don't have some polo adjustment, thank you so much for the donation. I'm a nice guy. All right. I'm done respecting this woman. The next couple of streamers, we're going to hit them with respect rates. What is this? What is she doing? Is she respecting women? No. Oh, God. What is this? Guys, we need to do something about this. This is what? We have to do something about this right now. What is this? This is Heathenny. It's time for a respect raid. Yeah, what? That's right. We need to raid her with respect. Spam? I respect women and chat. All right. I just told my subscribers to spam respect women and chat. All right. We got to hit her with the donate real quick. Respect. We got here to deliver respect. All right. We need to hit her with some respect. ASAP. I don't know what's going on here. You have to be up follower to chat. What is this crap? Hey. Has the male gender been kind to you lately? Oh, God. Mr. Beast 6000. Hey. Has the male gender been kind to you lately? I feel like they've not been mean. I saw this. I saw one person in discord that said two things in the past weekend that's pissed me off. But I feel like I'm just. That is unacceptable. Bothered on that? No. I feel like the male gender has not been that mean to me. And then I begah. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Only real women respect her. These are top donated tour. Ah. Oh my gosh. Only one. What? One of the respectors is a top down here. Who are you? Who are you? Thank you. Who are you? Mr. Beast 11, don't ask one. This song is from my favorite anime. Oh, God. All right. We have to respect her more. You get extra respect because I love her. Right. What? What? You love Paris I2 about to watch last three episodes tonight. Thank you so much. Oh, the last two episodes are kind of sad. And I am so thankful. I appreciate it. Ah. All right, Molly. I have more women to respect. I could be there well. Thank you. Thank you so much. Again, I super appreciate all of that. One, two, ten. How much do you respect women? I have a message. Hey, Mr. Beast 6000. On the scout of one team. How much do you respect women? Yeah, I respect women a lot, bro. A lot? I respect them a lot. It's going to have to be a team. Appreciate the $5, Mr. Beast 6000. Did he say he was a 10-year-old? Thank you. He's a 10 out of 10 respector? Oh, boy. We got it. This is for all my women respect. Of course, out there. Holy shit. Are you kidding me, bro? I don't know when the respector is out there. Are you kidding me, bro? Not, man. Are you kidding me, bro? This is for you. For respect and women. Mr. Beast, just donate $50. Hey, we're going to tweet out this girl's stream. Get her some hype going in the chat. And we're about to send some respect to her with. Wait, what is that, Torkey? I'm here to respect women. Not objectify them. Oh, she needs some respect. She needs some respect. She needs some respect, ready to... Hello, my lady. I am here to respect you. Thank you, Mr. Beast 6000. No! What is this? No! I'm trying to respect you. Put on a jacket. Please, I'm trying to respect you. Thank you, Mr. Beast. Pretty sure if you're respecting me, then you'll respect what I want to wear and not try to force me into it. Oh, okay. I respect your decision to not wear a jacket. That's wrong. Thanks, Mr. Beast. See, there's someone who respects women. I need a good thumbnail. Can you look really excited for me? She's going to be like $10. I can't be excited. $10, she just made $100. What are you times created? Oh, my God. I don't know how to... I'm a women-erspector. Not... I don't know how I look excited in the... I'm a store. I'm actually excited in a way that I don't think is the right kind of excited. She's literally running around in public saying Uganda is number one. What the fuck is Twitch? I can see the appeal in the stream. Uh, it's very entertaining. What the hell is this? Now, this is clearly a horse, so... I don't know if I have to respect it. I'm only here to respect women, not horses. You don't know the way. The way that you're gonna... I... I don't need any money. What is this thing gonna pop up? I appreciate you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Ah. We have a very important question to ask this man. On a scale of 1-2-10, how much do you respect women? Alright, boys, let's see if he respects women. Okay, that's cool. You know, I'm just paying $10. You know, don't respond to my message. That's fine. I love donating money and they not read the message. Lovely. She's not really respecting women that well, as you can see right here, but she does have a lot of anime figures in the background and, you know, that'll let it slide because of that. And then like, we have to watch something. Because me and my sister were gonna have a really kind of matching house like she was gonna go as female defeat. I don't know, I had like a bunch of characters. How long to do? I'll forgive you for not respecting women because you like anime. Thanks for the donation, Mr. Beast 6000. But what do you mean you forgive me for not respecting women? What is that supposed to mean? She doesn't even realize she's not respecting women. She looks like a beast. That's supposed to be like a comment towards showing my bobs. Not showing my bobs, but cleavage. All I'm saying is I'm a nice guy and here for your personality. Your PewDiePie would be proud. He would be proud. Well, the world's a better place. For some reason, guys can play about it. Uh-huh. All I'm saying is I'm a nice guy and here for your personality. Thank you again, Mr. Beast 6000. I appreciate your donation. And, and I can't talk to people who are being sarcastic or not. I'm here for your personality. I'm being dead serious. I'm a nice guy. I'm like, say sarcastically when, um, when girls are like showing too much cleavage and they'll be like, yeah, I'm here for your personality. I don't know what she's going on about. I'm just trying to respect women. That's all. I can't tell like, are these are troll donations or like if he's actually a nice guy? I'm not trolling. I'm just trying to respect you. Alright, she's probably going to get really confused because I don't even know what I'm saying at this point, but it's kind of fun. Hey, it's not easy respecting women. I'm just trying to respect her. What does she not understand? She thinks I'm trolling. Oh, well, I just wanted to respect her, but whatever. I'll go respect another woman. This woman looks like she's deprived of respect. I'm here for the rescue. Fear no more. I'm here for the rescue. I'm here for the rescue. I'm here for the rescue. I'm here for the rescue. I'm here for the rescue. I'm here for the rescue. Fear no more. I am here to respect you. By the way, guys, I love hard stones, so I'm a little biased towards her. Thank you, Beast. Thank you for the donation. You're here to respect me. She's a good man. I don't think she fully felt the respect there. She didn't fully felt respected. Oh my gosh, dude. Thank you, Mr. Beast. No problem. Just all the day of respecting. I think we have to hit her with some next level respect. Do you usually feel respected? Thank you, Mr. Beast. Thank you so much, dude. I just want to know if she felt respected. No, I don't feel respected. I think she didn't reply to my message because she's so used to not being respected. She doesn't know how to respond to this level of respect. We should step it up enough. She asked me why I wasn't talking in chat. That's because I just have too much respect. Only Heathens talking chat. She's not really fun to donate to. She's not really reacting much. I don't know. I don't know. I guess she's really just not used to being respected. She doesn't know what to do.",27370615,1118,,"I gave thousands of dollars to Twitch streamers.

I Bought The World's Most Expensive Apps ($10k),"I Bought The World's Most Expensive Apps ($10k)

 What's up fam squad today we're gonna be buying the most expensive apps in the entire world not clickbait because I don't value money intro The first app is called only for the richest and apparently it's just an app to show off how much money you have Honestly, it sounds perfect for me. All right. We got a fix. Let's see. I said it's only for the richest. Are you one of the richest? I'm a jackpaller. You better do it. How many of you use all those merch sales to buy it? Yeah, buy my merch. We're not gonna get sued like Logan Paul for stealing another company's brand. All right guys Moment of truth. Let's open up the app. It is I bought this app for a hundred and fifty dollars. Yay 5% goes to charity We just gave seven dollars to charity. Hell yeah, but why didn't we just give a hundred and fifty dollars to charity? Yeah, we needed the app for the video. Just kidding literally a hundred and fifty dollar app that just says I bought this app for a hundred and fifty dollars DDS GP this app actually looks kind of interesting. I like the graphics they got going on here Check out their views. I've been close to the developers. No one gives a crap. All right. Let's buy it This app is four hundred dollars, but dentists make six figures dude. This is a no-brainer by just call me Mr. Dentist I'm just a dentist. All right. Here we go boys were low nerup. Sorry about that glare Why does that glare sexually harassing you guys that is very decay? Oh, okay? There's real images too. Oh nope Not add to my favorite you sure No, I do not want you my favorite fuck off. Oh That Tucson fuck oh you're with the teeth that to set evolution is wrong. I'm the big tooth All right, did I get four hundred dollars worth the content out of it? I think so I don't think so up next We have the boo boo swaleo world cup horn plus plus premium, you know, this looks like a top quality app It's rated two and a half stars with two reviews pay makes successful hell yeah install. I'm ready for my boo boo swaleo horn All right so far looks like You pay two hundred dollars for that dude, honestly that should be like four hundred dollars. Why is it so cheap? I want to make this my car like the horn of my car now so it's not for nothing Wait, what I can see why it's so expensive this is advanced technology right here Oh, it closed what my new iphone x is awesome and it only calls it down but can it do this? Why would I want it to do that secretly jealous of the All right, I got a notification from the apps. Oh my god somebody bought my two hundred dollar app. What a fucking idiot? Yep, that's me someone make that a meme the next app is called I am rich it is four hundred dollars and Somehow it has four thousand reviews to be honest. I thought every review of this app was exaggerated and only for laughs Even so I still bought this app because I had money left to burn in the Amazon sale for four hundred dollars I don't understand how this app has a hundred thousand downloads and it's number four trending and finance It doesn't really make sense. So let's figure it out. Maybe this is the secret to Bitcoin. Thank God It's finally dying now. We don't have to hear about Bitcoin anymore But wait Jimmy you're the guy You can hear about Bitcoin. Oh, yeah, I was the annoying one. Whoops. My bad my my merch to be fair I really want to make a video where I give a homeless man a hundred thousand dollars because I think that would go hell of Viral so if you guys buy enough merch we can definitely do that video next week Just say you have zero diamonds watch video ads to get more diamonds you bought a four hundred dollar app And you have to watch ads what now show this app to your buddies that you purchased the most expensive app from play store This isn't the most expensive app. It's one of them, but watch video ads to get more diamonds Honestly, it makes perfect sense. I paid four hundred dollars to watch ads get the right answer and get real money Wait, you will lose your reward. I don't get a reward if I skip it for zoom I'm watching an ad I have a hundred diamonds boys you can mod diamonds tell you I Only in America do people pay four hundred dollars to watch ads honestly YouTube you should take some notes We don't want to buy YouTube red to get rid of ads. We want to pay four hundred dollars for more ads Come on YouTube. What do you do it on a serious note? I just paid four hundred dollars for an app just to get fifty seconds worth of content my video and you know This is basically the peak of evolution Top of the morning to you laddies the next app we're gonna be trying is a game. It's called super color runner That honestly looks like a gay pride flag. I'm from North Carolina and I'm supposed to be home I'm just kidding. I don't care what you do with your genitals put in whoever's mouth you want to let's buy this app Unrated. Oh shit. This is unrated. We better watch out boys So right there is the speed runner up and for some reason it's not opening up So I actually went to the store and we bought another tablet and we just downloaded it right there As you can see we downloaded it again and it's not working on this tablet either so Apparently this is just a broken app. It doesn't work on any tablets That's another two hundred dollars down to drain. Let me just remind you the merch links at the top of the description All right word on the street is this diamond app is way different than the other one the other one was just ads apparently This one's better right? They're telling me all right. Let's see all right 399 Why do I hear a baby crying in the background be quiet while it got Payment unsuccessful card decline my bank's like no one's stupid enough to buy all these apps Like this has to be fraudulent has my bank learned nothing. Let's try paypal. Let's see how that goes I don't think I'll just give us a little money paypal. Let's begin 30,000 dollars the random people. They'll let me buy this app Honestly, I'm surprised paypal hasn't like contacted the FBI and just been like you should investigate this kid Oh, hey download it. I hit open. Yep. Let's see it. I bought this for $400 giving a hundred and twenty dollars to charity. Yes Yeah, the other Apple you gave five percent the charity this gave 30% dude. This was amazing That's way worth it. I think of the tax write-off these apps are great I'm gonna look at all the charity they're doing that may be pocketing $280 doing nothing But so so far I think we spent like three thousand dollars and like 150 went to charity pretty successful day if you know Not gonna lie just you know, I'm not messing around like this is literally the app. That's it Just says I bought this for $400 and they're giving money to charity but good for them these other apps They're only giving five percent to charity. Yeah, I love all like bland that is we're giving it to charity like what charity They're like, I don't know. I need a new couch the charity for my butt I got so I did some digging and apparently I am rich premium is the thing now we buy I am rich But we've yet to buy I'm rich premium and I think I am rich premium is just leave some bounds ahead of the other two It has a hundred and fifty three one-star ratings and we all know the better you are the more haters you have That's why you got to keep dabbing payment successful. Wow Yes, all right. Let's wait for this bad boy didn't stop. That's just a wallpaper. I paid $400 for this wallpaper Jimmy our bills haven't been paid in three months. You're behind I have this wallpaper They're not gonna accept that as a payment Jimmy. I hate don't disrespect my wallpaper. Now leave me He's by that murder so I can get paid App review Review review review To be fair everyone else is copying me so I can copy other people you know a little bit So the next step is I VIP black. I don't know what it is But my monkey he's gonna explain it to you go ahead. Hi, I'm Paul. I VIP black is an app to where you get It's pretty much like a exclusive social media for rich people you get certain So apparently it's like social media for rich people is what he told me so as you can see right here It's about a thousand dollars. I want it. I want to be with the other paulers your payment method was declined I heard you You didn't knock on wood Which is one of your people are all right guys look look it actually oh my why look that glare every time that glitters It's like no no you're not allowed to see the phone as you can see it actually downloaded the F dude I'm actually kind of stoked. All right guys. This is my first time ever on here for already passed as the world's largest independent Airport VIP lounge program with more than 600 lounges in over 300 cities Security Boston Bob a blob. I don't know basically this IVIP thing looks like a complete ripoff that no one uses All right guys it finished downloading this app is called wheel burner like I said it was four hundred dollars three two one one whoa You're a fast boy. Oh returning boy. Oh, we're another turning boy. Oh my goodness. Wait. It says zero Three out of 32 what happens when we hit 32 Beat the next level. That's next thing right man. Dude. This is pretty realistic. It's almost like they use Google earth I can see why it's worth four hundred dollars like the engineering team on this dang It's kind of laggy. Honestly for a four hundred dollar app for a hundred dollars I would expect better frame rates for this type of money. We finished. What do I get nothing? Was it worth it worth it? Well four dollar app versus four hundred dollar app four hundred dollar app takes the cake We bought this tablet for the video and it was a $50 tablet and now it has $350 worth of apps on it. That's I feel like this tablet deserves a medal I should return this $50 tablet and demand they give me a thousand dollars because of all the apps on it It's no longer worth $50. These are premium apps. Those my friends are the most expensive apps in the world You're not really missing much and make sure you subscribe and turn on notifications first comment on all my videos It gets a hundred dollar gift card not joking turn on notifications subscribe cop the merch I just dropped it linked down below or mrb's dot shop I think it looks pretty good and it actually feels pretty cool And I'm you going to be given why most of the money I make off of it to like homeless people or you know Whatever I think will be a viral video. All right that brings me to my next step way This is my new merch. I'm selling now right here It's this beast look at this has the thing on the hood a little tiger It looks pretty dope you should buy my merch because I spend a lot of money on videos And I really don't make much money and so I could use money so buy the merch Sorry unlike most youtubers.

Can A Glowing 1000 Degree Sword Slice A Car In Half?,"Can A Glowing 1000 Degree Sword Slice A Car In Half?

 Here we are using our precise three flames to get the ball to exactly 1000 degrees. When it turns orange, that means the ball is 1000 degrees. That's what they taught you in public school. Our first science experiment is proving that size doesn't matter. Look at how easily that little ball defeated that big ball. My fellow small ballers, we have a chance. I love it now. It's like magic. Bro, that's really great. I want to breathe with something. Yeah, start from back up right now. Next we took the 1000 degree ball and tried to forge a flute to play a song for the gods. We'll cutie pie here our fries. Two, one. Very few people know this, but it's actually a scientific fact that spigetio scream when they feel threatened. Next we wanted to make sure the ball was using good hygiene because it's very important to brush your balls. Do you brush your balls? I brush my balls daily. I'll ever brush my right ball. And this next clip, we attacked the onions with all 3000 degree items. But little did we know that stretch warning was actually crucial. Layers! Onions have layers. These are onions I can petrify. I guess so. Alright, well this was a terrible idea. Next item. We decided to test which 1000 degree object is better at cutting a watermelon. The 1000 degree knife started quick but could barely make it through. The 1000 degree sword couldn't even make it through the watermelon skin. The 1000 degree ball is clearly the winner. I mean not only did it go through the skin, but it also made boiling hot watermelon soup, which clearly the 1000 degree king enjoys. Third. Next we wanted to see what would happen if we cut and already cut pizza with 1000 degree sword. And you guys won't believe what happened. After cutting the pizza, we decided to see what would happen if we cut a pizza with 1000 degree pizza. The prophecy is true. Global warming is not a myth. This ball represents the sun and this ice cream is clearly the polar ice caps wake up sheep. This 1000 degree sword represents all your CO2 emissions. Just look at how much you're damaging the polar ice caps. Stop with the axe spread. And finally this 1000 degree knife represents your carbon footprint carving and baking. And the earth. Name, Kyle, it's good, some cool stuff. Burning all these objects clearly made the 1000 degree knife and ball very dry. So we have 1000 degree a bottle of moisturizer to hydrate them. 1000 degree metal skin matters too. You guys obviously know the world is flat, but for some reason the government keeps telling us it's round. And that's because they're trying to keep globe sales highs because globe manufacturing actually makes up 84% of the earth's economy. But screw that, I don't care if 84% of the earth's money goes to making round earths, we're gonna prove to the world it's flat. Now kids, make sure you always wear protection during your naughty times. Even 1000 degree swords need to be careful. That's the swordest. Why don't they make fireproof condoms for 1000 degree swords? Fireproof condoms. We wanted to test an experiment and see if we poured hot sauce on our 1000 degree ball wouldn't make it hotter because it's hot sauce. So it should make it hotter. I don't think that's done that work. That is how it works. Here, we wanted to use a 1000 degree knife on a sandwich. Wait, that's a hot dog. No, it's a sandwich. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be between me and you Chris. Next, we decided to torch. What is this? This is an alien egg. You know, that looks like the minute. After we penetrated the alien egg, we dropped our hot bomb in its egg. When you're like me, you go through a lot of microwaves. And sometimes, you just don't have one laying around. So you decide to use a 1000 degree ball to pop some popcorn. Let's see how it tastes. Let's try popcorn out. It's not good. The toilet paper on the right is when you use toilet paper on a normal day. The toilet paper on the left is after you eat talkative. As you guys know, I still don't have a microwave. So I wanted to test and see which is better at cooking a pop tart. A 1000 degree ball or a knife. The results might shock you. Have you ever wondered what a 1000 degree knife does to an egg? Well, the results are excellent. It's like cooking it, but that's crazy. It doesn't want to stick to it. Don't you hate it when you try to put butter on your toast and it won't spread because it's just too cold? Drop a 1000 degree ball on it and then it's easier to spread. As you can see, since PewDiePie's clearly are God, even his picture cannot be harmed by a 1000 degree ball. This test basically proves he's immortal. Next, we're going to see how my channel holds up against a 1000 degree sword. It's no uploads for two weeks. Ah! Oh look, no! Ah, it's demonetization! I'm half a month since we donated to a Twitch stream right now. Now for the pinnacle. Here's for being a PewDiePie clone. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. Oh no, somebody just called you a leafy clone. Ah! Ah! It hurts you, it hurts. Everyone knows the standard unit of measurement is pizza boxes, not your stupid metric systems. So we wanted to see how many pizza boxes a 1000 degree ball could go through. Oh, there you go, watch it, watch it. This one was a side void. Whatever it takes, man. Whatever it takes, dude, we're throwing ashes everywhere. Who cares, it went through four boxes. This is the strongest substance ever made. It's stronger than obsidian for Minecraft. It's hard. So you're telling me that can break up city? Yes, so. Why doesn't Minecraft have sword? Oh, they do. Wait, oh, that was magic. I'm so confused. Watch it back. Play that back. We also wanted to see how well a 1000 degree ball could play Fortnite. And it turns out that a 1000 degree balls are actually better than ninja. Why don't all guys just play with their balls? Hello! You draw a smiley face? I wanted to take revenge on a fool because a pool almost made me sick in one of my recent videos. Chris wanted to do a joke about cutting his nuts. So here you go. Chris is cutting his nuts. Chris has no nuts confirmed. Next, we wanted to try to cook cookies with a 1000 degree knife. Because I'm sick of people baking cookies. You're supposed to cook them. It's literally in the name. Cookies! The Viking has a 1000 degree sword and is going to attempt to slice the card. This is the damn idea. Dude, Jake is so strong. I'm going to try to get a 1000 degree sword. I'm going to try to get a 1000 degree sword and try to get a 1000 degree sword. Jake is so strong. I see some smoke. Don't stab me. Next, we're going to attempt a 1000 degree sword versus card. And calm down there and save it for the card. We definitely didn't cut a hole using the saw and the car. So now cut it with your 1000 degree sword. Dude, just put the hole in there. Dude, he literally just took the sword and just cut the card in half. It's because he's a Viking. What a mad lad. What you do that, Jake? Wow, I just stabbed it. Now, what you're looking at right now is us doing the thumbnail. Obviously, as you saw earlier, we cut the card in half. So now we're just trying to get a cool thumbnail. Like, look at that pose. Oh, that's a good pose. I really like that one. That one's my favorite. Is it? I'm so shocked and sad. I can't believe someone would do this. Leave a like if you are depressed.",66555727,612,,"WILL THE SWORD CUT RIGHT THRU THE CAR?????
